 * Latest cryptify retry event observed during an upload or download.
 * pg-js v1.4 retries chunk PUTs and downloads with exponential backoff on
 * transient failures (5xx, network errors, internal timeouts). Components
 * subscribe to this store to surface "retrying… (attempt N of M)" status
 * during the retry window. `null` whenever the SDK isn't actively retrying.
 *
 * Cleared by the consumer (e.g. SendButton) on successful completion or
 * terminal error so a stale event doesn't leak into the next operation.
